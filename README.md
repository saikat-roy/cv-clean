# Clean Latex CV Template
A LaTeX template for a clean CV. Suitable for (but not restricted to) new grads or academics with some work experience.

Built with [Overleaf custom class guide](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/How_to_write_a_LaTeX_class_file_and_design_your_own_CV_(Part_1)) as a baseline and edited heavily.

This CV template is designed with the aim of providing a clean and compact way to represent a CV which has a few entries in the education (with or without a thesis) and experience sections, with some skills, publications, projects and maybe awards - that is a typical (near) grad student. The problem with most templates is that if you can manage squeeze in this information into the template, it looks either too dense or conversely, too overedited. This template is an attempt to offer a clean LaTex class for fitting all that information into a few pages.

The associated .tex file has my own CV as on 30/05/20 and contains all info necessary to reproduce the template.

Feel free to edit the class file in whatever way you deem fit to get your perfect variant of this layout. Or use it as a skeleton to build your own.
